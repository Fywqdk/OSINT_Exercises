### Exercise level:

For beginners: Hard
For experts: Medium


## Solution:

Tweet says it's Kiffa in the morning. Shadows go from left to right, thus direction of view is approx. south. The road is paved and has a slight bend with vegetation in the distance.  
Buildings on both sides, with the left hand one being larger and the right hand buildings extending into a small wall.  

Kiffa is a city in Mauritania.  
Using Google Maps to check out the main south-bound road out of Kiffa, it has a bend and vegetation.  
Immediately north are two buildings that look promising from the satellite.  

There is no streetview, but clicking on the location of "L’hôtel+de+kiffa+Mauritanie" shows the same image, so I guess that is the right place.  
This would make the building on the left the "Complexe justice commerciale".

Thus the image is taken approx. here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/VHwyR3gsccZXkvam8
