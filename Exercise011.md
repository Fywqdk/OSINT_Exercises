Your task is to identify them all.  

Click https://gralhix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/osint-exercise-011-big-picture.png to open the photo on a new window.  

### Exercise level:
For beginners: Hard
For experts: Hard

## Solution:

The image is a PNG file without any interesting metadata. Using the browser image search (Edge) leads to an article from United Nations with the same [picture](https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/01/520232).

The article is from 2016 with the summary text:
>The United Nations in Libya has expressed regret over the decision of the countryâ€™s Presidency Council to postpone the formation of a national unity government for 48 hours beyond the deadline set by a UN-facilitated political agreement, emphasizing that all efforts to combat and eliminate these terrorist groups must be led by the Libyan State.

However the image text lists:
>UNSMIL Signing of the Libyan Political Agreement in Skhirat, Morocco, 17 December 2015.

A further article from UNSMIL with photos from the signing confirm the same image is [from this session ](https://unsmil.unmissions.org/photos-libyan-parties-sign-libyan-political-agreement-skhirat-morocco-17-december-2015),  
however there are limited information about persons attending.

The photos does give closer view of the people in the original picture, as numbered below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c366c5f2-9b29-4171-820a-7cfaaf634fef)

It becomes harder from here on. A youtube video of the signing and speaches from the event does not seem to show the persons in the picture, and indeed with multiple empty chairs both left and right of the signing parties.  
On the other hand the original image does seem to show people signing papers.

Digging further a news clip from Al-Jazeera seems to have higher quality video and does seem to show the persons participating in the signing: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/17/rival-libyan-factions-sign-un-backed-peace-deal/  
also giving a glimpse of the face of the last person:

At this point it becomes a matter of browsing through hundreds of images from various peace talk events on Getty Images, hoping the picture text will reveal more.  

#### Person 1
Starting to dig deeper into the politicians of Libya around the time of signing, a recurring problem is the lack of (good) images of people, however the new Minister of Foreign Affairs  
**Mohamed Taher Siala** Seems to be person 1 ([Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Taha_Siala)), when accounting for aging.
Further image documentation [here](https://www.gettyimages.ie/search/2/image?family=editorial&phrase=mohamed%20taha%20libya&sort=oldest), though the oldest available seems  
to be 2016 in a meeting in with his Turkish counterpart.

#### Person 2
Another key person in the signing and negotiations was Tobruk-based House of Representatives member **Mohamed Ali Shoeb**, **Muhammed Shuayb**, **Emhimmed Shoaib**, **Imhemed Shaib**,   
(many spelling methods). He is in many images flanked by what appears to be person 3. While it is not a particularly good match as person 2, as he is clearly present in many other pictures from the event,  
I have not been able to confirm without a doubt that he is in fact person 2.


#### Person 3
After a long search I managed to find him signing a previous agreement [here](https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_image/public/old_dnn/body_images/InitialingAgreement11July2015_10.jpg?itok=3CCnSWDi).  
Another image from the same photo series shows a grainy picture of the signed agreement,  
and from that I was able to translate the text sufficiently to identify him as **Saleh Hamma Ahmad Bakdah**, Libyan Ambassador to Algeria per August 2024.

#### Person 4
Best bet is **Avad Muhammed Abdussadik**, Head of the National General Congress of Tripoli at the time, based on the other images from the signing.
