## Solution:

Using the in-browser image search leads directly to the website of **OAN RESORT** (a) in Mikronesia ([link](oanresort.wixsite.com)), with the name of the island being Oan.  
Googling the resort also leads straight to the island: [Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f9UhdL7beLLbPfeV9). The coordinates fo the island are: **7°21'49.1"N 151°45'22.5"E.** (b)  
The islands visible in the background (Faichuk Islands) are to the north-east of the island.
Neither a view straight north, nor straight west will resemble the camera direction. It is also not exactly North-west, rather I would say the camera direction is **North-North-West (NNW)** (c)
