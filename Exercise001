First Exercise: https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-001/

Solution: Tweet says it's Kiffa in the morning. Shadows go from left to right, thus direction of view is approx. south. The road is paved and has a slight bend with vegetation in the distance. Buildings on both sides, with the left hand one being larger and the right hand buildings extending into a small wall.

Using Google Maps to check out the main south-bound road out of Kiffa, it has a bend and vegetation. Immediately north is two buildings that look promising from the satellite. There is no streetview, but clicking on the location of "L’hôtel+de+kiffa+Mauritanie" shows the same image, so I guess that is the right place. This would make the building on the left the "Complexe justice commerciale"

Thus the image is taken approx. here: https://maps.app.goo.gl/VHwyR3gsccZXkvam8
