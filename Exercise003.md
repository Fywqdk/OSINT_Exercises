### Welcome to OSINT Exercise #003!
### Task briefing:

In April 2017 Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the then president of Somalia, visited Turkey. A  
news agency published a photo where he was seen shaking hands with Recep Tayyip  
Erdoğan, the country’s president. The article did not disclose where the photo was taken.  
Your task is to find out the name and coordinates of the location seen below.

### Exercise level:
For beginners: Medium
For experts: Easy

## Solution:

Very quickly found, by googling the names ("erdogan farmajo"), with one of the first sources listing them meeting at the **Presidential Complex in Ankara**, the capital of Turkey.

Further image searches for the complex confirms the same location for multiple other meetings between Erdogan and state leaders, e.g. with Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine:

The Facade of the complex including the door they seem to stand in front of, can be seen here from a nearby square on streetview:

The approximate coordinates of the door where they are standing is: **39°55'52.2"N 32°47'58.9"E**
