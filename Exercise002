So this is pretty easy to start out with. The image clearly states "Flinders Street" a railway station in Melbourne, Australia.

Again using google maps, it is quickly evident that the view is towards the south, and from the image it appears the darker building to the right is in the back and thus the highest despite looking a bit lower than in the picture.
Upon closer inspection, this building is actually today hidden by a much larger tower in front when looking from the train station.

The building in the back is "Focus Melbourne" or Focus Apartments at 81 City Rd, Southbank. It is 166 or 167 meters high depending on source. (Dwarfed by the newer Eureka Tower at around 300m which is not in the provided photo)
